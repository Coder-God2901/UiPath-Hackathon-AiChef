# UiPath-Hackathon-AiChef

## Overview

`UiPath-Hackathon-AiChef` is an application created for the UiPath Hackathon that helps with grocery bill management and recipe suggestions using AI-assisted features. The repository contains a frontend built primarily with TypeScript and React/Next-style components, a `grocery-bill-ai` notebook/module, and supporting UI components and styles.

This README provides installation instructions, how to run the project locally, the repository layout, and contribution guidance.

## Features

* Grocery bill parsing and analysis (AI-assisted)
* Recipe suggestion engine based on available items
* Interactive UI components and pages
* Example notebook(s) / utilities under `grocery-bill-ai`

## Tech Stack

* TypeScript
* React (component-based architecture)
* Next.js or a similar React routing framework (project contains `pages` and `components` folders)
* Node.js and npm/yarn for package management

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
* npm (v6+) or yarn
* Git (to clone the repository)

## Project Structure

A high-level overview of the repository layout (actual file names/folders may vary):

* `/components` - Reusable React components
* `/pages` - Page-level components or routes
* `/grocery-bill-ai` - Notebook(s), scripts, or utilities related to grocery bill AI features
* `/public` - Static assets
* `/styles` - Global and component styles
* `package.json` - Project metadata and npm scripts
* `App.tsx` or `index.tsx` - Application entry point

## Usage

* Browse the UI and use the grocery bill features exposed in the app.
* Check `grocery-bill-ai` for example notebooks and scripts demonstrating parsing, model usage, or dataset examples.
* If the repository relies on external AI APIs, ensure the environment variables are set and valid.

## Contributing

* Contributions are welcome.

* Suggested workflow:

  * Fork the repository
  * Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
  * Implement changes and add tests where applicable
